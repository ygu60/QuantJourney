# QuantJourney
Saw a similar repo by [Aniruddha-Deb](https://github.com/Aniruddha-Deb/quant-prep/tree/main), figured this would be a good way to document my quant journey. As of September 2025, I'm 3rd-year physics student at Washington University in St. Louis. This should hopefully document my journey from nothing to quant internship 2026.
